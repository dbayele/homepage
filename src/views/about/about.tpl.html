    <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

    <p>I've been writing software professionally for 2 1/2 years, but I started programming many years before that.</p>

    <p>I am a software developer working in the Seattle area. I love learning new things and solving problems. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, hiking and playing video games... oh yeah and eating.</p>
