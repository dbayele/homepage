<p class="project-info">The Holland America homepage has thousands of visitors a day and is the first impression online guests see. The goal was to modernize the site by transforming it from a Struts2 Java app into an <strong>AngularJS</strong> single page application. Some features include <strong>translation</strong>, <strong>localization</strong>, integration with a proprietary <strong>CMS</strong>, and integration with the existing site architecture. Finally, the Holland America homepage also supports <strong>SEO</strong>, a unique challenge for single page applications.</p>
